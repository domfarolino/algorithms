# algorithms

Solved (and usually heavily documented) online judge and classic CS problems as well as
various data structure implementations - almost exclusively in C++.

The purpose of this repository is to act as a curation of

 - Classic computer science algorithms (things like searching, sorting, knapsack,
   binary exponentiation, etc.)
 - Solved online judge algorithms from sources such like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com),
   [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org),
   and [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/).
 - Datastructure implementations.

The code in this repository is intended to be heavily documented and easily understood so that
the understanding of techniques and concepts is easily transferred. Inside the `src` folder you'll
see the folders `algorithm_practice` and `datastructures`. The contents of these folder is pretty
obvious, but each one has its own accompanying documentation to further explain the file structure and
organization involved.
