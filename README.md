# algorithms

This repository contains solutions and implementations to various data structures and
algorithms specifically in C++. Judged problems along with other classic CS problems 
are also contained within this repository.

## Contents
### 1. Data Structures

Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Min Heap, Queue, Queue from stacks, Stack, Vector

### 2. Algorithms

Array Algorithms, Bit Manipulation, Combinatorics, Data Structure Algorithms, Dynamic Programming
Geometry, Number Algorithms, Searching and Sorting, String Algorithms. For more information
Go into **file** (**Here.** [`algorithms`](./src/algorithm_practice))

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to act as a curation of

 - Classic computer science algorithms (things like searching, sorting, knapsack,
   binary exponentiation, etc.)
 - Solved online judge algorithms from sources such like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com),
   [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org),
   and [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/).
 - Datastructure implementations.

The code in this repository is intended to be heavily documented and easily understood so that
the understanding of techniques and concepts is easily transferred. Inside the `src` folder you'll
see the folders `algorithm_practice` and `datastructures`. The contents of these folder is pretty
obvious, but each one has its own accompanying documentation to further explain the file structure and
organization involved. 

## Usage

Each algorithm and data structure is contained in its own C++ .h file for datastructures
and .cpp file for algorithms. Maintain this format along with providing a readme when
adding a new data structure or algorithm. 

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and add your own data structures and algorithms.
Adding these new features and creating pull requests are welcomed!
