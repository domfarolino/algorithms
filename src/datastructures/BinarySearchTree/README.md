# Binary Search Tree

Binary search trees are very important and popular data structures. In this document (and repository), we
will be discussing the operations associated with BST's and their implementations. A binary search tree is a
binary tree with the condition that, given a root node, every node in the root's left subtree is <= the root's
value and every node in the root's right subtree is > than the root's value. This should hold true for every
node in the tree (this recursive bit is the important part!). The exact semantics of this definition (whether
or not we allow duplicate values, or if so, how we handle them) are implementation-specific. In this
implementation, we'll be allowing duplicates to appear in the left subtree of a given node.

Note that a binary tree is really a specific type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) when relating to graph theory.
While traversals on general graphs apply to all trees, some of the algorithms and traversals in this
implementation are specific to the binary (search) tree data structure.

### Implementation

Binary trees have the benefit of being really efficient data structures for lookup and find
operations, under the right conditions. Their common operations can have a time complexity
of `Θ(log(n))` in the best/average case, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree.
A common misconception about this data structure is that these and operations alike are *always*
`O(log(n))`, or `Θ(log(n))` in the worst case. This is not true. Many operations associated with
this data structure are `O(n)` because, without some extra work, there is nothing guaranteeing that
the tree is balanced, which is when we achieve optimal performance. For example, if I were to
insert 5 increasing values in a row into an empty binary search tree, I'll end up with the following
structure:

```
    1
  /   \
 ~     2
      /  \
     ~    3
        /   \
       ~     4
           /   \
          ~     5
```

...which is practically a glorified linked list with some extra wasted space. This gives us no
benefit specific to the BST ADT. We maximize profit from the BST when we keep it balanced. For
example, if I were to insert the values [`5`, `2`, `8`, `1`, `3`, `6`, `9`] into a BST I'd end
up with the following structure:

```
             5
           /   \
          2     8
         / \   / \
        1   3 6   9
```

...which is perfectly balanced, thus allowing us to take advantage of the BST's structure. With the
above structure, we can get `O(log(n))` insertions, removals, and lookups since the perfect balance allows
us to cut the number of examined nodes in half at each recursive call. This is how we obtain
`O(log(n))` operations. Often, we say in the average case a BST is relatively close to being balanced, thus
giving us efficient `O(log(n))` operations. Of course, in the actual worst case (completely linear), we cannot
do better than `O(n)`. There also exist self-balancing BST's which maintain a near-perfect balance throughout their
life, thus *always* giving us (amortized) `O(log(n))` operations. Maintaining a balanced structure is a little
more difficult and out of the scope of the fundamentals. :)

I'll also talk about some of the trends found in implementations of tree-style data structures. A lot
of generic algorithms that reside in data structures, like `add()` and `remove()`, only need to accept
a single value, being the data to insert or delete. With tree-based data structures, a lot of these algorithms
are recursive. This is a result of the underlying data structure being defined recursively. These algorithms
start at some node in the tree and figure out how to recurse further down the tree with some logic. The
algorithms are given a node to act as the "`root`" for the current call being made, and recurse down to
either the left or right subtree, or terminate. Initially, they must be called with the tree's actual "`root`"
node. This initial call requires access to private data (the tree's "`root`") to set the context for the first
call. To avoid exposing an API that requires private data, wrapper functions are often used to make this
initial call once for the user. For example, the public API for `add()` might accept a single value to add,
and then call the recursive `addHelper()` function with this value along with the tree's "`root`" node
(to set the initial context for the future recursive calls). The `addHelper` would take it from here, recursing
down the tree as necessary. You'll see this wrapper function pattern being used in the implementation in
this repository.

<a name="default-constructor"></a>
### `BST<T>::BST();`

Our default constructor doesn't really need to do anything. We just have an initialization
list which sets our internal `root` member pointer to `NULL` and our internal `_size` variable
to `0`.

<a name="size"></a>
### `int BST<T>::size();`

This just returns the value of our internal `_size` variable. We maintain this internal variable
instead of performing an entire tree walk every time we request the size for performance reasons.
This gives us `O(1)` size calculations as long as we properly maintain this variable when adding
and removing nodes from the tree.

<a name="empty"></a>
### `bool BST<T>::empty();`

This just returns whether or not our internal `_size` variable is `0` *and* our internal `root`
variable is `NULL`. Both are important so that we can more easily catch bugs in the case where
we empty the entire tree yet our `root` is not `NULL` or the `_size` variable is not `0`.

<a name="add"></a>
### `void BST<T>::add(T elem);`

<a name="add-helper"></a>
### `void BST<T>::addHelper(T elem, TreeNode<T> *root);`

To add a node to a binary search tree, it is best to consider the average case first. So let's take the
following BST:

```
      5
    /   \
   2     7
 /  \   /  \
~    ~ ~    ~
```

Assuming we want to add the value 11 to the tree, we'll start with the root and realize 11 will need
to be placed in 5's right subtree, as it is greater than 5. We'll then repeat this logic at the tree
rooted at 5's right subtree, 7. Again, 11 is greater than 7 so we'll need to place 11 in 7's right subtree,
however, 7's subtree is `NULL`. In this case, we don't want to recurse down another level and give a `NULL`
root to our function as the current root. We'd just end up setting this `NULL` pointer equal to a
new node and it would never actually be attached to anything. When adding a child node to a parent, we
need to have the parent in context so that we can attach the child directly to it. In other words, we
want to stop recursing at the last non-null node and attach a new child to it. Here's a quick visualization
of the recursion:

```
---------------stack frame-----------------+
add(root = 5, value = 11)                  |
  if (value > root && root->right) {       | // if we can recurse further
    add(5->right, 11);                     |
    +---------stack frame------------------+
    |add(root = 7, value = 11)             |
    |   if (value > root && root->right) { | // if we can recurse furhter
    |     //doesn't get reached            |
    |   } else (!root->right) {            | // if we've hit a leaf node, give it a child
    |     7->right = new Node(10);         | // attach the child
    |   }                                  |
    +--------------------------------------+
                                           |
-------------------------------------------+
  }
```

Note the above function must take in a root, which will be the tree's private `root` initially. This means that it
must be called from our `add` wrapper function the first time in order to get the private `root`.

With the above statements, it is clear that, in general, the `addHelper` function will never have to deal with a `NULL`
root in the average case. This means we won't have to perform any `NULL` checks in the beginning of our function before
accessing things like `root->left` and `root->right`, since root will always be non-null.

Now it's time to consider the edge case in which the root of the actual tree is `NULL` (tree is empty). How can our algorithm
handle this? We could of course add a `NULL` check at the beginning of our function, though this is a little wasteful since we'd
only *need* to perform this `NULL` check the very first time, since we just saw that in the average case we'll always be given
a non-null root. The smart way to handle this is to cater to the edge case in the wrapper function `add` that calls the
recursive `addHelper` algorithm. Here, we're going to be dealing with the private `root` variable so we can check to see if
the actual tree's `root = NULL` before passing it along. If so, we can create the root, thus adding the very first
node in the tree. If not, we can pass it along like we normally would. Yeah! We've successfully condensed our edge case
handling logic so we're not performing extraneous NULL checks when unnecessary.

<a name="exists"></a>
### `void BST<T>::exists(T elem);`

<a name="exists-helper"></a>
### `void BST<T>::existsHelper(T elem, TreeNode<T> *root);`

The `exists` and `existsHelper` methods have similar mechanics to the `add` method above, so a lot of the boilerplate will
be skipped. The idea behind this algorithm is fairly intuitive in that we just want to recurse down the tree until we either:

 1. Find the node we're looking for
 1. Or get to a `NULL` node (the one we're looking for didn't exist)

In the average case of a full tree with our node somewhere in the tree, we'll eventually recurse downward comparing the value
we're given against the value of the current frame's root node. We'll start the whole thing off with the actual root of the tree,
suggesting we'll need a wrapper function to kick this off. When recursing downward, there is no need to check if the subtree we're
about to recurse to is `NULL` before we recurse like we did with `add`; instead we can just recurse to it and check in the
next frame if that root is `NULL`. Doing both would yield in extraneous `NULL` checks. With this information, we know the wrapper
function `exists` doesn't have to provide any logic at all. It can just simply kick off the first call of the `existsHelper`
function with the private `root` of the tree.

<a name="remove"></a>
### `void BST<T>::remove(T elem);`

<a name="remove-helper"></a>
### `void BST<T>::removeHelper(T elem, TreeNode<T> *root);`

Removing a node from a BST is more difficult than adding or finding and, since most sources tend to show the solution with little
or poor explanation, I intend to start with the basics to explain how this algorithm works. There are only three cases to consider
when removing a node from a binary search tree:

  1. The node-to-remove has no children (is a leaf node)
  1. The node-to-remove has one child
  1. The node-to-remove has two children

Of course, there is the trivial case in which the node-to-remove does not exist in the tree. However that's not what we're focusing
on, as we pretty much get that for free.

#### Removing a node with no children

Consider the following tree:

```
  5
   \
    6
```

Removing `6` from the above tree is as easy as navigating to the node (we've already seen how to do this) and simply deleting
it, as its removal doesn't affect any other part of the tree. This is very similar to deleting the tail of a linked list.

#### Removing a node with one child

Consider the following tree:

```
  5
   \
    6
     \
      8
     / \
    7   9
```

Removing `6` from the above tree is as easy as making the `5->right` pointer point to the node-to-remove's only subtree
(thus bypassing our target node) and then deleting `6`. We'd end up with the following tree:

```
  5
   \
    8    // 6 got bypassed and then deleted
   / \
  7   9
```

This is very similar to deleting any middle-node in a linked list.

### Removing a node with two children (most complex case)

Consider the following tree:

```
      5
    /   \
   2     7
    \   / \
     4 6   8
```

Removing `5` from the above tree is a bit less obvious, mainly because its successor is not completely straightforward. It is
tempting to think that we must pick either the `2` or `7` to replace the `5`, but that requires us to rearrange a lot of the
tree afterwards. Instead, we can pick a successor that requires practically no extra work, the closest
value to the node we're removing. The two closest values to `5` in the tree will be the maximum node in its left subtree (`4`),
and the minimum node in its right subtree (`6`). Note that no matter which we choose as a successor, no rearranging will be
required. This is because the smallest node in `5`'s right subtree (`6`) is still larger than all nodes in `5`'s left subtree,
meaning `5`'s left subtree can also be the left subtree of `6`. Since `6` is the smallest node in `5`'s right subtree, all
nodes in this subtree can equally comprise the right subtree of `6` upon succession. So the question at this point is which do
we choose, the `4` or the `6` as the successor? You might think it doesn't matter but it actually does! Consider the following
tree:

```
      5
   /     \
  2       7
   \     /
    3   6
   /   /
  3   6
```

The two trees we can get as a result of choosing either `3` or `6` as `5`'s successor are as follows:

```
 Choose 3         Choose 6
     3       |      6
  /     \    |    /   \
 2       7   |   2     7
  \     /    |    \   /
   3   6     |     3 6
      /      |    /
     6       |   3
```

Note only one of the above trees is valid! Remember the invariant that we introduced in the first paragraph that talks about how
we handle duplicates? You may recall that given any node `n`, the nodes in `n`'s left subtree will have values <= `n`'s
value, meaning duplicates of a particular node will only appear in the node's left subtree. The tree on the right in the above
example breaks this invariant because `6` has a duplicate in its right subtree when we promote it to the new root. In short, if
we allow duplicates in the left subtree of a particular node, we must always *choose our successor from the node-to-remove's left
subtree* to maintain this invariant upon succession. This is a minor but possibly important detail that, as stated in the first
paragraph of this document, depends on exactly how an implementation chooses to handle duplicates.

Finally, to actually achieve the structure above, we want to replace the value of `5` with the value of `3`. This will leave us with
an extra `3` in the left subtree since we just copied its value. At this point, we can call the `removeHelper` algorithm on `3`,
starting at the left subtree of the node whose value just got replaced. Removing the extra `3` is guaranteed to be a trivial
operation since it is the maximum value in the left subtree, therefore it can have at most one child. Thus, we've successfully
boiled down the case of deleting a node with two children into performing a simple copy, and deleting a node with at most one child!

#### Implementation

The implementation of this algorithm is a little tricky, but you'll notice that in the above sections we made many comparisons to
removing nodes from a linked list. A BST is basically a more complex linked list, and the traversal required to find a node in a BST
is similar to that of a linked list. Once found, deleting a node from a BST is basically the same as deleting one in a linked list in
`2/3` possible cases. In the third more complicated case, we simply perform a value copy and boil the problem down into a trivial
case. Let's first consider how we'd iteratively and recursively delete a node from a linked list.

We can write a function to iteratively delete a node from a linked list rather simply. Assuming the node-to-remove is not the
list's `head` (an edge case), we'd create a temp node pointer `tmp`, initially set to the `head` of the list, and iterate forward
until `tmp->next` points to the node-to-remove. We stop when `tmp->next` is our target node because we must have a
reference to the node before the one we wish to delete in order to seal the gap once we delete it. We can implement basically
the same logic with a BST (see the `removeIterative` method), however many tree algorithms are naturally recursive,
which can actually cut down on the complexity of our logic. The space complexity of the iterative solution will also be much
cheaper.

When recursively deleting a node from a linked list, we'll start at the `head` node and recurse forward on each `head->next` until
we find the node-to-remove. Since recursion is just an accumulation of stack frames, let's consider an arbitrary frame when thinking
about how this algorithm works. Let's assume we're looking at the `head` of a list in some stack frame. If `head` contains the value
we wish to remove, we'll simply delete it and return `head->next`. If it doesn't, we assume the node-to-remove exists somewhere later
in the list and recurse onto `head->next`. Notice though, `head->next` may be a different node once the recursion is complete due to
the nature of the algorithm. If `head->next` is removed, the node after `head->next` will be returned in its place. This means we
should set `head->next = deleteNode(head->next, targetValue)` when we recurse forward in case the next node did get deleted. This
assignment is idempotent otherwise. Notice how in the iterative version we needed a reference to the node before the one we wished
to delete, whereas with recursion this reference is kept implicitly for us in the form of stack frames. This simplifies our logic
because we can focus on deleting the current `head` of any arbitrary stack frame and navigate accordingly.

The recursive `removeHelper` member function behaves very similarly to the aforementioned algorithm though, there is additional
logic to navigate the `left` and `right` children properly, as opposed to `next`, and some value copying logic for when
we wish to delete a node which has two children. Once we perform the copy, we can just call the recursive algorithm on the
left subtree to remove the duplicate successor's value (the trivial case).

<a name="remove-iterative"></a>
### `void BST<T>::removeIterative(T elem);`

This method is undocumented, though part of its logic is expressed in <a href="#remove-helper">removeHelper</a>. See the source.

<a name="clear"></a>
### `void BST<T>::clear(T elem);`

<a name="clear-helper"></a>
### `void BST<T>::clearHelper(T elem, TreeNode<T> *root);`

This is a basic DFS algorithm to completely delete a tree. The idea is we can only delete a node once both its left and right
subtrees are completely deleted. Since the tree structure is defined recursively, our algorithm can recurse downwards, re-visiting
a node once both of its subtrees are cleared and it's time to delete the local root. The internal `_size` variable should decrement
every time a node is deleted.

<a name="min"></a>
### `TreeNode<T> BST<T>::min(T elem, TreeNode<T> *root);`

This method is fairly trivial. Given some `root`, we want to traverse as far down its left subtree as we can go,
as this is where smaller and smaller values will exist. The node returned should have a `NULL` left child.

<a name="max"></a>
### `TreeNode<T> BST<T>::max();`

Same as <a href="#min">min</a> but for the maximum value instead of the minimum.
