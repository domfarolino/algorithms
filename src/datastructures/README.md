# datastructures

The purpose of this folder is to hold fundamental data structure implementations
in C++. Most of the data structure folders have good documentation accompanying
them and follow roughly the same format.

# Design and naming

The design and naming conventions of containers in this subdirectory follow
those described in the Chromium
[`//base` principles](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/README.md#design-and-naming).
In other words, STL-like containers should follow STL conventions, even when
this conflicts with the Google Style Guide. Generally however, the Google Style
Guide caters to these naming conventions anyways; see
[Exceptions to Naming Rules](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Exceptions_to_Naming_Rules).
