/**
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
 * sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until
 * the number = 1 (where it will remain), or it loops endlessly in
 * a cycle which never includes 1. Those numbers for which this process
 * ends in 1 are happy numbers. We need some way to tell whether a number
 * gets repeated (and is in the infinite cycle, thus not happy). We could
 * use an unordered_set for this, however previous research shows that repeated
 * numbers will never go above 999, therefore we could keep a boolean array to act
 * as our set. Everytime we come across a number we set its value in our array to true
 * and every time we come across a number, if its index in our array has ever been set
 * to true we know this number is unhappy and can quit trying.
