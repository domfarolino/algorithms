/**
 * Sort an array according to the order defined by another array
 *
 * This problem can be very similar to sorting an array based
 * off of the natural number ordering. Normally we can tell if a pair
 * of numbers are inverted by checking their values, because their values
 * happen to directly correspond to their indices in the order of natural integers.
 * This means we can easily tell that 1 < 2, however given the custom orders array
 * [2, 1, 8, 3] we cannot trivially tell that 2 < 8 without knowing the indices of both
 * of those numbers in the custom orders array. We can keep a hash table to store these values.
 * Storing these values will take O(m) where m = the length of the custom orders array, and retrieval
 * is O(1) given we have a O(1) hashing algorithm. So we can turn [2, 1, 8, 3] into the unordered map:
 *
 * u_map[2] = 0
 * u_map[1] = 1
 * u_map[8] = 2
 * u_map[3] = 3
 *
 * Then when we come across 2 and one in our array, we can tell that 2 should be less than 1 because
 * u_map[2] < u_map[1]. The rest is a basic implementation of mergeSort with a small modification to accept
 * the unordered_map. This is the same as writing a custom comparator to index the array that defines our custom
 * order.
 *
 * We could also use a strictly hashing method. This could be done by taking all of the numbers in our array to sort
 * and in a hashmap, inserting {number: count}, and for every number in our custom order array, output some number the
 * number of times it appears in our hash map given it exists, and remove it from the hashmap. For all numbers left over
 * in our source array (still existing in our hashmap), we can do one of two things. If we want them in sorted order given
 * their natural indices, all we have to do is sort the remaining numbers in the hashmap which takes O(plog(p)) time where p
 * is the number of elements left in our map. If we want them in the order they came in then we can maintain some vector alongside
 * our hash map to push_back() each value as we come across. Then at the very end for each value in the vector that does exist in
 * the hmap, put it at the back of our sorted array. This method demonstrates the classical tradeoff between speed and time. The time
 * complexity of the ending portion of this method is O(p) however we must keep double the space. However since our space complexity
 * increases from O(n) to O(n) + O(n) = O(2n), its asymptotic complexity does not actually increase.
 *
 * The below algorithm implements mergesort using the unordered_map as a custom comparator. Again, we could use a strictly hashing
 * method, or actually abstract our usage of the unordered_map in the below merge() routine to a custom comparator.
 * Complexity analysis of the following solution:
 * Time complexity: O(mlog(m) + n) m = size of source array, n = size of order array - note we have to hash each value in the array indicating element order
 * Space complexity: O(m)
