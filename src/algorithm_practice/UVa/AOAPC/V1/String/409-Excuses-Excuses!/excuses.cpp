/**
 * 409 - Excuses Excuses!
 * The theory behind the algorithm is rather simple.
 * Basically what we need to do is for each set, for each
 * excuse iterate through the entire keywords vector and see
 * how many times each excuse keyword appears in the excuse. Maintain
 * a running total variable that keeps track of how many excuses total
 * appear in an excuse string. Associate that total number with the excuse.
 * In this algorithm that is done by storing a vector of pairs in which the
 * first value is the excuse and the second value is its total number of excuses.
 * Maintain a maximum variable as well that keeps the max number of excuse keywords
 * that have appeared in an excuse string. With this, we can iterate through the vector
 * and print all of the excuses whose associated value of total excuses matches the maximum.
 * The excuses that will be printed will be printed in the order we received them. Possibly the
 * trickiest coding segment of this algorithm will be figuring out how many times a single word appears
 * in an excuse string. This is because we have to verify the appearance of of a keyword is valid given
 * its surrounding characters (or lack thereof). We then try and find the next occurrence of that keyword
 * after the first occurrence (if there was one to begin) and keep going until string::find returns npos.
 * Complexity analysis:
 * Time complexity: ADD THIS
 * Space complexity: ADD THIS (10/06/16)
