U=120V and I=5.36A. What is the reason for calculating p? I cant understand ?
There was a p who has P=560W Which was destroyed by U=291.89V.
No chance if P=111.11W and I=3.004A.
U=200VI=4.5A.
U=220VP=100.00W.
P=2.5MWI=2A.
bla bla bla lightning strike I=2A bla bla bla P=2.5MW bla bla voltage?
If the voltage is U=200V and the current is I=4.5A, which power is generated?
A light-bulb yields P=100W and the voltage is U=220V. Compute the current, please.
gU=200VI=4.5A.
gU=220VP=100.00W.
tP=2.5MWI=2A.
PU=200VUI=4.5A.5W
A light-bulb yields P=0W and the voltage is U=220V. Compute the current, please.
I light-bulb yields P=1W and the voltage is U=2V. Compute the current, please.
A light-bulb yields I=-1A and the voltage is U=-2V. Compute the current, please.
