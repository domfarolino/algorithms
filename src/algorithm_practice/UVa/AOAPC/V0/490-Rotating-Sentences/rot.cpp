/**
 * Rotating Sentences
 * Cool problem that sounds harder
 * than it is. Basically we want to maintain
 * some vector of all of the sentences we're given.
 * We want to print some character from each of the
 * sentences in the vector n times, where n is the
 * length of the longest string. What happens when we
 * need to print the 20th character of a string that only
 * has 10? In this case we do a quick boundary check, and
 * print a single space instead. Since we're rotating the
 * sentences 90 degrees, we need to start printing characters
 * from the last sentence first and make our way backwards for
 * every character we have to print. Once all that is worked out
 * the coding is fairly straight forward.
