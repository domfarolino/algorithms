# Geometry Algorithms

Geometry algorithms are those that deal with geometric entities, often in 2D space,
and employ algorithms that solve problems related to those entities. Some examples:

 - Given two rectangles, determine whether or not they intersect
 - Given _n_ points on a 2D surface, return the number of points on the same line

If a problem explicitly focuses on things likes lines, rectangles, points in space, area,
distance, convex hulls, etc., it should probably appear here.
